# Autonomous Contract Lawyer with RAG Technology

Welcome to the Autonomous Contract Lawyer project! This project aims to revolutionize contract management by developing an innovative system that enables natural language interactions with contracts. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, our system empowers users to ask questions, seek clarifications, and extract key information effortlessly.

## Business Objective

Our mission is to build, evaluate, and enhance a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored specifically for Contract Q&A scenarios. By integrating advanced language models with external knowledge bases pertinent to contract law, we aim to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

## Project Structure

- **backend**: Contains backend logic for handling user queries, integrating external knowledge bases, and managing contract-related information.
- **data**: Stores contract documents, datasets, and other relevant data.
- **frontend**: Contains frontend components for natural language interaction with contracts.
- **notebooks**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and experimentation.
- **utils**: Houses utility functions and modules used across different parts of the project.
- **main.py**: Main entry point of the application.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies required for the project.
